These are the directions for building drmingw for use within
COSMOS to catch segfaults and provide useful Ruby debugging
information on Windows

Required:
1. Ruby Installed and in your path
2. Ruby Devkit installed but not yet in your path

Steps:
1. Download and extract drmingw-0.6.4.zip from:
    https://github.com/jrfonseca/drmingw/releases
2. Copy the patched CMakeLists.txt and exchndl.c files into drmingw-0.6.4/src
3. Add devkit to your path by running:
    C:\Devkit\devkitvars.bat
4. In the drmingw-0.6.4 base directory run from a cmd prompt:
    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles"
5. The above step will fail due to sh being in your path
6. Close and reopen the command prompt
7. In the drmingw-0.6.4 base directory run from a cmd prompt:
    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles"
8. Add devkit to your path by running:
    C:\Devkit\devkitvars.bat
9. Compile:
    mingw32-make
10. Copy src/exchndl.dll and src/mgwhelp.dll to cosmos bin folder
11. Rename exchndl.dll to exchndl20.dll or exchandl21.dll based on the version of ruby used to compile
12. Repeat with the other version of Ruby if necessary
