- :REQUIRE:
    :summary: Requires a Ruby file
    :description: Ruby files must be required to be available to call in other code.
      Files are first required from the target's lib folder. If no file is found the
      Ruby system path is checked which includes the base COSMOS/lib folder.
    :parameters:
    - :FILENAME:
        :type: string
        :description: Filename to require. For files in the target's lib directory
          simply supply the filename, e.g. "REQUIRE my_file". Files in the base COSMOS
          lib directory also should just list the filename. If a file is in a folder
          under the lib directory then you must specify the folder name, e.g. "REQUIRE
          folder/my_file". The filename can also be an absolute path but this is not
          common. Note the ".rb" extension is optional when specifying the filename.
        :values: ".*"
        :required: true
- :IGNORE_PARAMETER:
    :summary: Ignore the given command parameter
    :description: Hint to other COSMOS tools to hide or ignore this command parameter
      when processing the command. For example, Command Sender and Command Sequence
      will not display the parameter (by default) when showing the command and Script
      Runner code completion will not display the parameter.
    :parameters:
    - :PARAMETER:
        :type: string
        :description: The name of a command parameter. Note that this parameter will
          be ignored in ALL the commands it appears in.
        :values: ".*"
        :required: true
- :IGNORE_ITEM:
    :summary: Ignore the given telemetry item
    :description: Hint to other COSMOS tools to hide or ignore this telemetry item
      when processing the telemetry. For example, Packet Viewer will not display the
      item (by default) when showing the packet.
    :parameters:
    - :ITEM:
        :type: string
        :description: The name of a telemetry item. Note that this item will be ignored
          in ALL the telemetry it appears in.
        :values: ".*"
        :required: true
- :COMMANDS:
    :summary: Process the given command definition file
    :description: This keyword is used to explicitly add the command definition file
      to the list of command and telemetry files to process.
    :warning: Usage of this keyword overrides automatic command and telemetry file
      discovery. If this keyword is used, you must also use the TELEMETRY keyword
      to specify the telemetry files to process.
    :parameters:
    - :FILENAME:
        :type: string
        :description: Name of a command definition file in the target's cmd_tlm directory,
          e.g. "cmd.txt".
        :values: '.*\.txt'
        :required: true
- :TELEMETRY:
    :summary: Process the given telemetry definition file
    :description: This keyword is used to explicitly add the telemetry definition
      file to the list of command and telemetry files to process.
    :warning: Usage of this keyword overrides automatic command and telemetry file
      discovery. If this keyword is used, you must also use the COMMAND keyword to
      specify the command files to process.
    :parameters:
    - :FILENAME:
        :type: string
        :description: Name of a telemetry definition file in the target's cmd_tlm
          directory, e.g. "tlm.txt".
        :values: '.*\.txt'
        :required: true
- :AUTO_SCREEN_SUBSTITUTE:
    :summary: Automatically substitute the target's name in screen definitions
    :description: Targets can be renamed when they are declared which would break
      any screen definitions using the explicit target name. This keyword automatically
      replaces the target name in the screen definitions with the actual target name.
    :warning: Replaces ALL target names in a screen definition file, so this is not
      suitable for screens with multiple targets.
    :parameters: []
