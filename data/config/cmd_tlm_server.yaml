  summary: Defines a connection to a physical target
  description: Interfaces are what COSMOS uses to talk to a particular piece
    of hardware. Interfaces require a Ruby file which implements all the interface
    methods necessary to talk to the hardware. COSMOS defines many built in interfaces
    or you can define your own as long as it implements the interface protocol.
  parameters:
    - name: Interface Name
      required: true
      description: Name of the interface. This name will appear in the
        Interfaces tab of the Server and is also referenced by other keywords.
        The COSMOS convention is to name interfaces after their targets with
        '_INT' appended to the name, e.g. INST_INT for the INST target.
      values: ".*"
    - name: Filename
