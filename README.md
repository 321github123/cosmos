# COMING SOON!

## Welcome to Ball Aerospace COSMOS

Ball Aerospace COSMOS provides all the functionality needed to send commands to and receive data from one or more embedded systems referred to as "targets". Out of the box functionality includes: Telemetry Display, Telemetry Graphing, Operational and Test Scripting, Command Sending, Logging, Log File Playback, Table Management, and more.

COSMOS is built and maintained by Ryan Melton (ryanatball/ryanmelt) and Jason Thomas (jmthomas) at Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.

## Getting Started

1. Install COSMOS at the command prompt if you haven't yet:

        gem install cosmos

   Note on non-windows systems you will need to have all necessary prerequisites installed (primarily cmake and qt 4.8.x)

2. At the command prompt, create a new COSMOS project:

        cosmos demo test

   where "test" is the application name.

3. Change directory to `test` and start the COSMOS Launcher:

        cd test
        ruby Launcher

   Run with `--help` or `-h` for options.

4. Click on the various tools to start experimenting with COSMOS!

5. Follow the [Documentation](https://github.com/BallAerospace/COSMOS/wiki) to start developing your configuration.
